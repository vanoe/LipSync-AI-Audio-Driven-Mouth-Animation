# 👄 Lip Sync Technology

## 🎬 Intro Description
Lip Sync is an **AI-powered technology** that matches spoken audio with realistic mouth movements, making characters, avatars, and videos look natural when they speak.  
Instead of relying on slow manual animation, the system uses **advanced models** to automatically align voices with lip movements.  
✨ This creates smoother, more engaging results for films, games, social media, and virtual communication.

👉 From improving animated movies to making avatars in video calls feel more lifelike, **Lip Sync bridges the gap between voice and visuals.**
